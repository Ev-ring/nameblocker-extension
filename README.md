An extension made by me that automatically blacks out any names in a webpage. Great for when you're working on confidential data.
Issues: 
- Doesn't reload content.js functions properly after moving to a new page or reloading, only if you manually reload the extension
- Doesn't keep track of the last names
- Can't use most websites due to an issue with the JavaScript not being allowed

Ideas:
- Make the extension work based off a user-inputted list of names, reading through a .txt file for each name, storing them in an arraylist, and censoring out the names in the arraylist.
- Improve the user interface to be more user friendly
- Instead of a list of names, always censor specific elements on Kit where the names will be.
